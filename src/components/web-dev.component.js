			The EventTracker hooks up to a PI System and reads all EventFrame data. This data is organized and
			displayed in an intuitive format for the user, giving them valuable insight into their production process.`,

		description: `Barge Unloads is a web application I developed for Cargill. At one of their sites they
			regularly unload grain commodities from barges. Cargill wanted more insight into this unloading process:
			1. Which parts of the unload process are slow?
			2. Are the current unloads on-time?
			3. What are our recent totals?

			The Barge Unload application helps answer these questions by:
			1. Displaying unload histories with on-time indications broken down by process sections.
			2. Displaying gauges representing the progress of current unloads.
			3. Displaying totals for the previous day alongside target values.`,
